# Summary
Pulling useful data from large public files is important to data analysts in order to make large datasets more manageable for analysis.

Large public datasets may have irrelevant info that analysts may not need or needs to be kept confidential in order to protect the identity, maintain confidentiality.

We used Pandas, Python, and Jupyter Notebooks in order to extract and transform a large data set into smaller, more manageable csv files.

We created a crowdfunding database with separate contacts, campaign, category and subcategory dataframes and exported them into csv files in order to be more manageable.
